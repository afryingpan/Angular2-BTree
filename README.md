# Angular2 - BTree

A 2-3-4Tree/BTree visualizer created in angular2. 

This was an old school Java project I converted into an angular2 web app. The tree starts off as a 234Tree, with the option to convert it into a BTree with an order of 5, 6, 7, or 8.

I got the idea for this while tutoring students on this project. I wanted to refresh my memory while expanding my angular skills.
